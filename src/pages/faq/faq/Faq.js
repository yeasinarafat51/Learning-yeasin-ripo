            <h1>Who is this course for ?</h1>
            <p>Who wants to become a web developer. For those who want to learn web development from scratch and then get a job in a software company as a web developer. For those who don't know much about programming or web development. Even those who have studied CSE for four years and could not decide what to do, did not learn much, they can learn complete web development from this course and apply for jobs.</p>
            <h1>What do I need to know before starting this course ?</h1>
            <p>Since we are teaching from scratch. So you don't need to know anything beforehand. But if you have time, you can do these three things. 1. You need to keep some brain space to get the things in your head after watching the video. 2. Just joining the course will not make you an auto web developer. Must have a hard-working, stick-to-it mentality. 3. If you get stuck somewhere, you have to have the mentality of asking for help and the will to stick around.</p>
            <h1>How long will it take to complete this course ?</h1>
            <p>If you watch videos for 1 to 1.5 hours every day, along with extra 4 to 6 hours of practice, it will take you about 5 months. However, sometimes extra time should be reserved for homework and take away projects. Must bring hard work mentality. There are no cheats or shortcuts.</p>
